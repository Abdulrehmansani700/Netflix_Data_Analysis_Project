# Netflix_Data_Analysis_Project
 Projects For Cloud Data Engineering 
This project demonstrates a complete End-to-End Data Engineering pipeline to analyze Netflix Movies and TV Shows. It covers everything from data ingestion and cleaning using Python to advanced data modeling and analysis using SQL Server.

# 🏗️ Project Architecture
The pipeline follows these systematic stages:

* Data Ingestion: Downloading the raw Netflix dataset.
* Data Cleaning & Transformation (Python): Handling missing values and formatting using Pandas.
* Data Load (Raw Layer): Loading the cleaned data into SQL Server.
* Data Modeling & Further Transformation: Using SQL for structured modeling.
* Final Analysis: Extracting insights via SQL queries for business reporting.

# 🛠️ Technologies Used
* Language: Python (Pandas/SQLAlchemy)
* Database: Microsoft SQL Server
* Design Tool: Draw.io (for architecture)

# 🚀 Key Insights Explored
* Trends in content release over the years.
* Country-wise distribution of Movies vs. TV Shows.
* Analysis of ratings and popular genres.
